### Assumptions

#### Inputs
1. Exactly one scenario must be selected, except for payments

#### Payments
1. We are assuming all money is in today's dollars
1. We are assuming that if a payment was started in the past, that the down payment and regular payments are in the dollars of the time. I.e. not adjusted for today's dollars
1. We are assuming that if a payment was started in the past, that these payments are incorporated into the monthly savings calcs and no changes will be made until after the last payment, when your savings monthly amount will be raised by the payment amounts

#### Calculations
1. We are assuming that in this month (month 0), everything is already trued up. So what you have in all of your accounts will remain until the end of the month. Then the start of next month, all adjustments for payments, interest, ect. will be made. 
  1. That is, contributions first, then interest

1. We are assuming that you need to be within these ages
