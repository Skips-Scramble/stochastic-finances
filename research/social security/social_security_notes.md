## Social Security Notes

#### Taxes
- Combined Income=Adjusted Gross Income (AGI) + Tax-Exempt Interest + ½(Social Security Benefits)
- If your combined income is between $25,000 and $34,000 ($32,000 and $44,000 for couples), up to 50% of your benefits may be taxable.
- The calculation is as follows:
  - If your combined income is in this threshold, then your taxable SS is 50% of the amount of your combined income above the minimum threshold
  - Example
    - Non-SS income: $20,000
    - SS income: $20,000
    - Combined income: $20,000 x (1/2) * 20,000 = $30,000
    - Amount of taxable SS: 50% * (30,000 - 25,000) = $2,500
    - Full amount you'd owe taxes on: $22,500
- If your combined income is above $34,000 ($44,000 for couples), up to 85% of your benefits may be taxable.
