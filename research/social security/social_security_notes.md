## Social Security Notes

#### Taxes
- Combined Income=Adjusted Gross Income (AGI) + Tax-Exempt Interest + ½(Social Security Benefits)
- If your combined income is between $25,000 and $34,000 ($32,000 and $44,000 for couples), up to 50% of your SS benefits may be taxable.
- The calculation is as follows:
  - If your combined income is in this threshold, then your taxable SS is 50% of the amount of your combined income above the minimum threshold
  - Example
    - Non-SS income: $20,000
    - SS income: $20,000
    - Combined income: $20,000 x (1/2) * 20,000 = $30,000
    - Amount of taxable SS: 50% * (30,000 - 25,000) = $2,500
    - Full amount you'd owe taxes on: $22,500
- If your combined income is above $34,000 ($44,000 for couples), up to 85% of your benefits may be taxable.
  - Example
    - Non-SS income: $45,000
    - SS income: $20,000
    - Combined income: $45,000 + (1/2)*20,000 = $55,000
    - Pay the 50% on the SS income between $25,00 and $34,000, so $4,500
    - Amount of taxable SS income at 85%: 85% * (55,000 - 34,000) = $17,850
    - Total amount of SS that's taxable: $4,500 + $17,850 = $22,350
      - But it's capped at 85%, so you only owe taxes on 85% * $20,000 = $17,000
    - The amount you owe taxes on is $62,000

#### Compensation
- You get the average of the income from your 35 highest-earning years.
  - This in inflation-adjusted
- Take the total of those 35 highest years and divide by 35*12 = 420 months. This value is your Average Indexed Monthly Earnings (AIME)
- To calculate your monthly check, follow this calculation:
  - 90% of your AIME below $1,174 +
  - 32% of your AIME between $1,174 and $7,078 + 
  - 15% of your AIME over $7,078
  - with a max total of $4,873 (as of 2024)

#### Claiming Early/Late
- The formula for claiming early for every month you claim early (up to 36 months), you get dinged 5/9 of 1%. If you claim earlier than that, you get dinged 5/12 of 1%
- The formula for claiming late is for every month you defer, your SS increases by 2/3 of 1% per month you delay
- These are additive, so you just multiple the number of months before or after FRA by these percentages
- Born on January 1st means you get put in the previous year
- Born on the first of the month means your birth month was the previous month
  - I.e. you need to be 62 for the entire month you review SS
